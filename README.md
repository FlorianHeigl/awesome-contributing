## Writing a Contributing.md On GitHub

GitHub [automatically opens](https://github.com/blog/1184-contributing-guidelines) up a banner pointing to a Contribute.md file. This means that anyone who opens an issue or a pull request will know to check your Contributing guidelines! Newcomers will be the main target - experienced users will have memorized anything in your Contribute, and won't need it to guide them. Because of this, you want to make sure it is as accessible as possible.
